The given function has a string (str) and two characters, ch1 and ch2. Execute the function in such a way that str returns to its original string, and all the events in ch1 are replaced by ch2, and vice versa.
Replacecharacter(Char str1, Char ch1, Int 1, Char ch2)

Assumption

This string has only alphabets that are in lower case.

Example

Input:
str: apples
ch1: a
ch2: p

Output:
paales

Explanation
All the ‘a’ in the string is replaced with ‘p’. And all the ‘p’s are replaced with ‘a’.

Explanation
Initialization: We initialize an empty list (or an array) to store the modified characters.
Iteration: We iterate through each character in the string.
Condition Check: For each character, we check if it matches ch1 or ch2 and replace it with the respective other character.
Construction: We construct the result string from the modified list (or array).
Output: The final string with the characters swapped is returned.
