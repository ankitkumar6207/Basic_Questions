Explanation
Split the string into words: Iterate through each character of the input string. Whenever a space character is encountered, store the current word and reset the word accumulator. Continue until the end of the string.
Reverse the order of words: Traverse the list of words from the end to the beginning and construct the reversed sentence.
Handle spaces properly: Ensure that spaces are added between words appropriately while constructing the reversed sentence.
